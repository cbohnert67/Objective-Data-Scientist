# Objective Data Scientist !

**A carefully designed plan for becoming a good Data Scientist with Python.**

Data Science is a new and complex field. It appears as an extension of statistical modeling and uses programming, software engineering and AI techniques to solve in domain expertise problems.

*Data Scientist are better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.*

Becoming a good data scientist requires a combination of education, skills, and experience. 

Here are some requirements to improve your chances of success in this field:

- Get a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science: Data science involves working with large amounts of data, and a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science is essential for understanding and applying statistical and machine learning techniques.

- Learn programming languages: Data scientists need to be proficient in at least one programming language, such as Python or R, in order to manipulate and analyze data. It is also helpful to have some knowledge of SQL for working with databases.

- Acquire statistical and machine learning skills: Data science involves applying statistical and machine learning techniques to extract insights from data. It is important to have a good understanding of these techniques and be able to apply them effectively.

- Gain experience: As with any field, experience is key to becoming a good data scientist. Consider taking on data science projects as part of your coursework or as a side project, and try to get internships or entry-level positions in the field to gain practical experience.

- Stay up to date: Data science is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important to stay up to date with the latest technologies and techniques. Consider taking online courses or attending conferences to continue learning and staying current.

The curriculum is designed for a several years log journey in Data Science. 

I compiled best material (web and books) I find useful for that purpose. So let's get started and jump right into foundations!

## Step 1. Mathematical & Computational Foundations

Choose one or more material from each topic and expect to work for at least one year in order to learn these concepts and tools well!


### Multivariable Calculus:

Multivariable calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with functions of multiple variables and extends the concepts of single-variable calculus. It allows for the analysis of functions and their behavior in higher-dimensional space.

### Linear Algebra: the mathematics of matrices and data.

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations and their representations in vector spaces. It is a fundamental mathematical toolkit for understanding systems of linear equations, as well as for studying advanced topics such as least squares methods, eigenvalues, and singular value decompositions.

### Probability & Statistics:

Probability and statistics are two closely related fields of study that deal with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. Probability is the study of random events and the likelihood of their occurrence, while statistics is the application of probability theory to the collection and analysis of data.

### Mathematical Analysis:

Mathematical analysis is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of limits and the properties of functions. It is a broad subject that includes many subfields such as calculus, differential equations, and real analysis.

### Numerical Methods:

Numerical analysis is a branch of mathematics that deals with the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms for solving problems involving continuous variables. It is a broad subject that includes many subfields such as numerical linear algebra, numerical optimization, and numerical differential equations.
