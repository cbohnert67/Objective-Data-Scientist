# Objective Data Scientist !

A carefully selected set of learning material for becoming a skilled Data Scientist with Python.

Data Science is a new and complex field. It appears as an extension of statistical modeling using programming and domain expertise.

Data Scientist are better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.

With the explosion of available data and computational power, machine learning techniques and tools are developed fast.

It is a life long learning journey to get skilled as a Data Scientist. 

One has to build solid foundatiosn either in applied mathematics and programming.

This is hence the first step in your Data Science journey. Expect at least one year to learn these concepts and tools!
