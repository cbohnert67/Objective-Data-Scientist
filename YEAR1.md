# Year 1: Mathematical & Computational Foundations

Choose one or more material from each topic. Expect to work for at least one year in order to learn these concepts and tools well!


## Multivariable Calculus:

Multivariable calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with functions of multiple variables and extends the concepts of single-variable calculus. It allows for the analysis of functions and their behavior in higher-dimensional space.

## Linear Algebra:

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations and their representations in vector spaces. It is a fundamental mathematical toolkit for understanding systems of linear equations, as well as for studying advanced topics such as least squares methods, eigenvalues, and singular value decompositions.

## Probability & Statistics:

Probability and statistics are two closely related fields of study that deal with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. Probability is the study of random events and the likelihood of their occurrence, while statistics is the application of probability theory to the collection and analysis of data.

## Numerical Methods:

Numerical analysis is a branch of mathematics that deals with the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms for solving problems involving continuous variables. It is a broad subject that includes many subfields such as numerical linear algebra, numerical optimization, and numerical differential equations.

## Programming & Computational Thinking

Computational thinking is a way of solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior that draws on concepts fundamental to computer science. It involves breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable pieces, identifying patterns and relationships that can help solve the problem, and using logical reasoning to come up with a solution. The goal of computational thinking is to take complex problems and find ways to solve them in a systematic, efficient way.

## Computational Mathematics

Computational mathematics, also known as mathematical computing or scientific computing, is the study of algorithms and methods for the numerical solution of mathematical problems. It is a field that encompasses a wide range of topics, including numerical analysis, scientific computing, and mathematical modeling.
